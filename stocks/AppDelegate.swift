     - January/2020 Made me give up everything I’m paying for fun (games, going out with friends) for four months because I paid too much for my medical expenses even though I’m making 140k a year and this cost only $500.
     - February/2020 Backing out on her word that I can game and watch videos before bed. Kicking me out of the room for watching videos while she is asleep. Yanking headphones out of my ears to force me to stop watching. Saying that agreements don’t matter to her anymore and she doesn’t care.
